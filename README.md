# Twincat 3 - Factory IO Conection
In order to connect twincat with factory io the OPC-UA protocol can be used, to set up the conection the function [TF 6100](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-us/products/automation/twincat/tfxxxx-twincat-3-functions/tf6xxx-tc3-connectivity/tf6100.html) must be installed. In addition, the licence of this function must be enabled, as well as the TCM file option as shown below.
